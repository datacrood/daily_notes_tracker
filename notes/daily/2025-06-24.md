# Daily Notes - 2025-06-24

## Quick Stats
- **Date**: 2025-06-24
- **Day of Week**: Tuesday
- **Week**: 26
- **Energy Level**: [1-10]
- **Focus Score**: [1-10]

## Morning Intentions
- **Primary Goal**: 
- **Secondary Goal**: 
- **Mindset**: 

## TO DOs
1. How to find data and create mixed model to find out outlier classes: (a) Ball near goal post (b) Ball outside the field (c) Throw in balls (d) Ball occluded and near player body
    - Hypothesis testing: Creating multi class model: trainning on multiple classes that are not exactly mutually exclusive like ball and player are.
    - Hypothesis testing: How single class training like just ball outside the field works alone

## Data Ideas to increase the dataset for each class
ETA? 1 hour
- goalpost model + ball model -> inference -> find frames where both = true
- Outside data -> Get homography and detrimine if outside the field
- outlier data being saved form live match = as legs/occluded ball etc... data
[] Thow in from event data from statsperform.

## Tasks
[] Complete code till tracker (test it's up and runnning state)
[] Create local testing loop for whole codebase testing
## Tracking down work
- While refactoring code here were my thoughts:
    - Cricket game 
    - Claude based suggestions
    - game based --> Either going class methods or function method to provide game specific
    - Path independent codes
    - Local testing setup: call main.py (basis sqs message) vs calling fb_model_engine.py for direct folder structure
    - Creating a centralised config manager

## Small things
- cricket game requires old tracker of YOLO_Tracker and Tracker.

## Notes & Insights
- 

## Distractions & Interruptions
- Distracted by goal post detection: checking out Kunal testing
- Taking time to understand the codebase, didn't expected it to take time.
