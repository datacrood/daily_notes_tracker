# Daily Notes - 2025-06-24

## Quick Stats
- **Date**: 2025-06-24
- **Day of Week**: Tuesday
- **Week**: 26
- **Energy Level**: [1-10]
- **Focus Score**: [1-10]

## Morning Intentions
- **Primary Goal**: 
- **Secondary Goal**: 
- **Mindset**: 

## TO DOs
1. How to find data and create mixed model to find out outlier classes: (a) Ball near goal post (b) Ball outside the field (c) Throw in balls (d) Ball occluded and near player body
    - Hypothesis testing: Creating multi class model: trainning on multiple classes that are not exactly mutually exclusive like ball and player are.
    - Hypothesis testing: How single class training like just ball outside the field works alone

2. Data Ideas to increase the dataset for each class
ETA? 1 hour
- goalpost model + ball model -> inference -> find frames where both = true
- Outside data -> Get homography and detrimine if outside the field
- outlier data being saved from live match = as legs/occluded ball etc... data
- Throw in: Detect player bbox top and ball bbox bottom(if they match or near) = throw in

## Tasks
[] Complete code till tracker (test it's up and runnning state)
[] Create local testing loop for whole codebase testing
[] Thow in from event data from statsperform.

## Tracking down work
- While refactoring code here were my thoughts:
    - Cricket game 
    - Claude based suggestions
    - game based --> Either going class methods or function method to provide game specific
    - Path independent codes
    - Local testing setup: call main.py (basis sqs message) vs calling fb_model_engine.py for direct folder structure
    - Creating a centralised config manager

## Later -- Side tracks
- cricket game requires old tracker of YOLO_Tracker and Tracker.

## Notes & Insights
- Final Dataset outlier classses: 
    1. Near_goal_post + corner_kicks (clear line): zoomed in? Source? Goal videos + penalty + saves + chance + corner zoomed in (clear white line similar braod to goalpost).
    2. outside_field_ball_like_objects = moving + static + big white spots: from other images wherever see outside objects.
    3. ball_in_hand = Throw in + collected + general_ball_in_hand (zoom out view + some zoom in view): Source? qualifier Id data stats, 
    4. ball_in_control = occluded behind or between legs + player kicking ball: Data source? When number of players are very close (more than 6 players are near). 
    5. Gloves, Shoes, Head, Wrist band
    Hard cases like outlier collected from human loop

    5. Ball hard negatives: no category: gloves, shoes
    6. Research: gloves category, shoes category, advertisements letters
- Can disregard: ball in mid air: green grass (not aobve air)

## Idea
- Same categories created from test (sacred data), it will be used for solely testing purposes
- We can run outlier model parallely to main model to avoid class imbalances between main ball. There could not be mutually exclusive.

## Distractions & Interruptions
- Distracted by goal post detection: checking out Kunal testing
- Taking time to understand the codebase, didn't expected it to take time.

## Evening Reflection
- **What went well**: 
- **What could be improved**: 
- **Tomorrow's focus**: 
- **Gratitude**:
